<!--About The Project-->
## About The Project
This application will prompt users to enter side values for a triangle. The application will then process the input and return whether a valid triangle can be created with the given values. If the values are valid, the application will also return the type of triangle created and its angles.

### Built With
<ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>XAML</li>
  <li>WPF</li>
  <li>.NET Framework</li>
  <li>Visual Studio</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started
Ensure that VS is already installed on your machine. Download a zipped copy of this code by going to the "<> Code" tab and expanding the green code button near the top right. Then press "Download ZIP".

Once that is done, unzip the folder using a program like <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> and open the project in VS by launching the solution file (.sln) found in the folder.

Alternatively, you can also press the green code button and copy the HTTPS Git link. You can use that link to clone a local copy of this application to your device. See the "Installation" section below for more info on this process.

### Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li>
    Install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio<a> (any version will work)
  </li>
    <li>
      Make sure to install the ".NET desktop development" workload (contains components for WPF applications)
    </li>
</ul>

### Installation
If you want to clone this repository for future use instead of downloading the zipped folder, you can do so by running the following command(s) using Git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sovsay11/TriangleApplication.git
```
    

## Usage
This application was primarily created to showcase various features of WPF applications for a test project. The application can be used to validate side values of a triangle to see if they form a valid triangle. Triangle type and degree values should also be returned if possible.
