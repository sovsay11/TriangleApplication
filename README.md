## Getting Started
IMO, the most straightforward way to get a local copy of this set up is to have VS already installed on your machine. Download a zipped copy of this code by going to the "<> Code" tab and expanding the green code button near the top right. Then press "Download Zip".

Once that is done, unzip the folder and open the project in VS by launching the solution file.

### Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li>
    Install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio<a> (any version will work)
  </li>
</ul>

If you want to clone this repository for future use instead of downloading the zipped folder, you can do so by running the following command(s) in Git:

```sh
